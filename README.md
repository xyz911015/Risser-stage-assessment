# Risser-stage-assessment
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spine deformity governed of the spine. A child's Risser stage of skeletal maturity must be carefully considered for AIS evaluation and treatment. However, there are intra-observer and inter-observer inaccuracies in the Risser stage manual assessment. A multi-task learning approach is proposed to address the low precision issue of manual assessment. With our developed multi-task learning approach, the iliac area is extracted and forwarded to the improved Swin Transformer for Risser stage assessment.
